transcripTools
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/abc-igmm/transcripTools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/abc-igmm/transcripTools)

**About & Installation**

A collection of functions that I've found myself using time and time again for transcriptomic analysis.

transcripTools can be installed directly from github via `devtools::install_github("abc-igmm/transcripTools")`. The devtools package itself can be installed using `install.packages("devtools")` within an R terminal.

If you need help, even if it's simply *"I have no idea where to even start"* then just email me at dominic.pearce@ed.ac.uk

**Contributing**

If you'd like to add your own code this [guide](http://www.datasurg.net/2015/07/13/rstudio-and-github/) should help those of you using Rstudio. Be sure to skip the steps for *"Create New project AND git"* and go straight to *"Clone an existing GitHub project to new RStudio project"*. 

Alternatively, for those working directly from the commandline, simply `git clone https://github.com/abc-igmm/transcripTools` and then `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` as normal or watch this [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9XZQO1n_7c).

**Direction**

- [x] Actually write decent examples so others can use the functions with confidence
- [ ] heatmapArrange includes hierarchical clustering code that could exist as it's own standalone function
- [ ] Write tests, code coverage is currently at 0%...
