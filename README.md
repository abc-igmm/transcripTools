transcripTools
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/abc-igmm/transcripTools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/abc-igmm/transcripTools)

**About & Installation**

A collection of functions that I've found myself using time and time again for transcriptomic analysis.

transcripTools can be installed directly from github via `devtools::install_github("abc-igmm/transcripTools")`. The devtools package itself can be installed using `install.packages("devtools")` within an R terminal.

If you need help, even if it's simply "I have no idea where to even start" then just email me at dominic.pearce@ed.ac.uk

**Direction**

- [x] Actually write decent examples so others can use the functions with confidence
- [ ] heatmapArrange includes hierarchical clustering code that could exist as it's own standalone function
- [ ] Write tests, code coverage is currently at 0%...
