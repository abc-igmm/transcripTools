#' NKI invasive breast cancer expressionSet
#'
#' Originally used as a[validation dataset for the 70-gene MammaPrint signature
#' (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12490681) this dataset has grown 
#' slightly in size but still is effectively the same collection of invasive 
#' breast cancer samples of no specific subtype. More information can be found 
#' in the bioconductor package's web page but, because there are issues with 
#' installing this on windows I've simply included the data here as part of 
#' transcripTools. 
#'
#' @format An expressionSet with 337 samples and 24481 features, as well as 
#' phenotypic and feature data
